# Welcome to My GitHub!
I'm Muhammad Chenariyan Nakhaee, a dedicated data enthusiast. At the moment, I'm working on GenAI projects in a Dutch company but I'm interested in how I can communicate effectively with data through visualizations and storytelling.
## My Passion

While my professional focus revolves around PySpark and Python, my true passion lies in the world of R and data visualization. I believe in the storytelling power of data, and I'm always excited to explore new ways of presenting information in a visually compelling manner.
