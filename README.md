# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Muhammad, an analytics engineer based in the Netherlands, working for a dynamic Dutch company. In my day job, I specialize in leveraging the power of PySpark and Python in conjunction with AWS to extract valuable insights from large datasets.

## My Passion

While my professional focus revolves around PySpark and Python, my true passion lies in the world of R and data visualization. I believe in the storytelling power of data, and I'm always excited to explore new ways of presenting information in a visually compelling manner.

This GitHub repository is a collection of my personal projects, experiments, and tools that reflect my interests and skills. From PySpark scripts and Python notebooks to R projects and captivating data visualizations, you'll find a diverse range of content that showcases my journey in the realm of analytics.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and connect with me on anything related to analytics, data engineering, or the art of visualizing data. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the vibrant GitHub community.
